# Group Project

We have explored various methods and conducted experiments on extracting vital signs using wireless modalities through lectures and labs. Now, let's dive in and get hands-on with the ESP32-C5 embedded system to further explore opportunities for extracting motion and breathing rates from Channel State Information (CSI) and transmitting the data to a PC via MQTT. The typology and scenario of the experiments is depicted as follows:

### Hardware Requirements

- **Two ESP32-C5 Boards**: One board acts as a transmitter, and the other as a receiver.
- **Placement Guidelines**: Ensure the two boards are placed at least **1 meter apart** for effective CSI sensing.

### Software Setup

In the traditional Wi-Fi CSI sensing, the transmitter typically operates in **station mode**, while the receiver functions in **monitor mode**, establishing a direct link for wireless sensing. However, **Espressif** has introduced **ESP-NOW**, a connectionless Wi-Fi communication protocol that enables data transmission without requiring a traditional Wi-Fi connection. In this approach, both the transmitter and receiver remain in **station mode**, deviating from conventional methods and offering a more flexible solution for CSI sensing. 

### Development Tool

The ESP-IDF environment is required. You should download this tool from the official GitHub website [here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf). The basic usage of the ESP-IDF tool can be referred to in the support documents on Moodle.

### Flashing the Firmware

Run the following commands to flash the firmware onto the ESP32-C5 boards:

```bash
# Flashing the transmitter
cd csi_send
idf.py --preview set-target esp32c5
idf.py build flash monitor -b 115200 -p /your/port

# Flashing the receiver
cd csi_recv
idf.py --preview set-target esp32c5
idf.py build flash monitor -b 921600 -p /your/port
```

The results can be seen as follows:

### CSI Data Format

A single row of raw CSI data includes metadata and CSI values. Example:

> type,seq,mac,rssi,rate,noise_floor,fft_gain,agc_gain,channel,local_timestamp,sig_len,rx_state,len,first_word,data CSI_DATA,0,1a:00:00:00:00:00,-55,11,159,19,40,8,837230,44,0,234,0,"[-5,-28,-4,-27,-5,-33,-4,-30,-2,-33,-3,-33,-3,-33,0,-35,-1,-35,1,-36,3,-36,2,-34,1,-35,3,-36,5,-34,3,-38,3,-34,7,-36,5,-36,4,-34,8,-35,2,-34,5,-35,4,-34,3,-34,3,-33,3,-34,6,-32,3,-37,3,-32,7,-34,3,-33,3,-32,4,-33,2,-34,3,-32,2,-34,1,-33,-2,-31,1,-30,2,-30,0,-31,-2,-28,0,-31,-1,-29,-1,-28,-1,-29,-1,-28,-1,-28,-4,-27,-3,-27,-4,-24,-5,-25,-6,-25,-7,-24,-8,-24,-7,-24,0,0,0,0,0,0,-23,7,-22,8,-22,9,-20,9,-20,10,-20,9,-20,11,-18,9,-18,12,-17,11,-16,12,-15,11,-14,12,-15,13,-12,13,-14,13,-11,12,-12,12,-12,13,-12,16,-10,14,-11,15,-10,13,-9,15,-10,15,-8,14,-8,14,-7,15,-6,15,-6,15,-6,16,-4,15,-4,15,-3,14,-5,15,-4,16,-2,18,-2,16,-3,17,-3,17,-2,16,-1,17,0,17,0,16,-2,15,1,17,0,15,-2,18,-2,14,-2,14,-1,15,0,15,-1,16,-2,16,-1,15,-2,13,-3,12]"
> 
- **Metadata Fields**: Include `type`, `seq` , `mac`, `rssi`, `rate`, `noise_floor`, `len`, `first_word` , etc.

- **CSI Data Array**: Stored as an array of values in **[imaginary, real]** format for each subcarrier.

In the benchmark dataset, the CSI data will be stored as CSV files, which are structured as follows:

- **Headers**: Each CSV file contains multiple headers, with the last column representing the CSI values.

- **Data Shape**: The CSI data is stored in a **time (row) Ã— subcarrier (last column)** format, with a sampling rate of 100 Hz.

## Materials

For each group participating in the benchmark, the following materials are provided:

- *TWO ESP32-C5 boards* for TX and RX respectively
- One package of basic source code
- Benchmark dataset
  

### 1. ESP32-C5 Boards

Each group will receive two ESP32-C5 boards: one for the transmitter and one for the receiver. Below are some key considerations:

1. Each ESP32-C5 board has two serial ports for flashing and data transmission: **UART** and **USB**. The assigned serial ports may vary depending on the PC used.

2. When flashing the board, if one serial port is unavailable, try using the other. Additionally, run `idf.py clean` or `idf.py fullclean` before the next flash attempt to ensure a clean build.

3. Do not change or mistake the bitrate when flashing the sender and receiver board:
    - **Sender board:** 115200 bps
    - **Receiver board:** 921600 bps

4. Ensure that your **ESP-IDF toolchain** is properly set up and can successfully connect to the board. By default, the sender board only needs to be flashed once; it will then automatically transmit ESP-NOW packets when powered by a battery.

5. If the compiled binary file exceeds the default flash memory limit, use `idf.py menuconfig` to increase the *Flash size* (default is 2 MB) under *Serial Flasher Config*.
    
    ![Serial flasher config of idf.py menuconfig.](src/esp32_flash.jpg)
    
6. Carefully check the **short-circuit wire** on the board and ensure it remains in place. Do not remove it.
    
    ![Short-circuit Wire of ESP32C5.](src/short-circuit_wire.png)
    
7. ESP32-C5 has two different layouts; however, they function the same for all applications.
    
    ![Two different layouts.](src/two_layouts.jpg)
    
8. When flashing, please avoid the register error, which is harmful for the hardware.

### 2. Code Package

We provide a basic package of source code, located in the `esp32c5/csi_send` and `esp32c5/csi_recv` folders. Both subprojects share a similar folder structure, including `CMakeLists.txt`, `main/`, `main/app_main.c`, `main/idf_component.yml`, and more.

#### 2.1 Implementing Required Tasks

You should implement the required tasks in `main/app_main.c` for both the `csi_send` and `csi_recv` folders. Each block starts and ends with the comment: 

```c
// YOUR CODE HERE
// END OF YOUR CODE
```

Besides that, you can also add other functions at the proper position freely if necessary.

#### 2.2 Compilation and Component Management

In addition to `main/app_main.c`, both the manifest file `main/idf_component.yml` and the CMake file `main/CMakeLists.txt` play crucial roles in the compilation process:

- **`main/CMakeLists.txt`**: Manages the technical aspects of building the component.
- **`main/idf_component.yml`**: Provides metadata and dependency information for component management.

To include additional components (such as `esp-dsp`), modify the `main/idf_component.yml` file following YAML syntax ([documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/idf-component-manager/en/latest/reference/manifest_file.html)). Additionally, update the `idf_component_register` function in `main/CMakeLists.txt` to ensure proper integration of the new components.

#### 2.3 Diagram of `TX app_main.c`

The figure below illustrates the implementation diagram for the TX `app_main.c` file. A key parameter, `CSI_Q_ENABLE`, controls whether CSI data is stored in a buffer `CSI_Q` or sent via a serial port.

- When **`CSI_Q_ENABLE = True`**, the received CSI data is stored in a queue buffer `CSI_Q` and updated using a **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** mechanism by `csi_process()`. The buffered data can then be sent via MQTT using `mqtt_send()`, allowing two methods of data transmission:
  - **Method 1 (Blue Path - Data: CSI)**: CSI data is sent directly to the PC via MQTT, where on-PC algorithms can be implemented.
  - **Method 2 (Red Path - Data: Results)**: On-board algorithms such as `motion_detection()` and `breathing_rate_estimation()` process the buffered CSI data, and the results are sent to the PC via MQTT.

- When **`CSI_Q_ENABLE = False`**, CSI data is sent through a serial port instead. This setting is useful for verifying whether TX has been successfully flashed and is collecting data. However, it must be set to `True` for other tasks.

- The function `wifi_csi_rx_cb()` handles the reception of CSI data. Based on `CSI_Q_ENABLE`, it either processes the data in a buffer for onboard calculation or outputs it via serial.

- You need to properly implement `csi_process()` to store and analyze CSI data and modify the `mqtt_send()` function to transmit either raw CSI data or processed results.

### 3. Benchmark Dataset

We provide two benchmark datasets, each designed to facilitate the evaluation of different wireless sensing tasks: motion detection and breathing rate estimation. These datasets contain Channel State Information (CSI) recordings, which serve as the core data source for developing and benchmarking CSI-based sensing algorithms.

The dataset structure is as follows:

```bash
benchmark
|---- breathing_rate
|   |---- evaluation
|   |---- test
|---- motion_detection
    |---- evaluation_motion
    |---- evaluation_static
    |---- test
```

Each dataset is split into two parts:

- **Evaluation Set**: Labeled data used to benchmark algorithm performance.
- **Test Set**: Unlabeled data reserved for performance validation, contributing 20% of the overall task assessment.

#### 3.1 Motion Detection Dataset

The benchmark dataset for CSI-based motion detection is stored in the `benchmark/motion_detection/evaluation_motion` and `benchmark/motion_detection/evaluation_static` directories. Each folder contains CSI files labeled according to their respective categories, representing either **motion** or **static** states.

1. The evaluation dataset comprises CSI files categorized into motion and static states, forming a binary classification problem.

2. Our benchmark method achieves **100% accuracy** on the labeled dataset (`evaluation_motion/` and `evaluation_static/`), effectively distinguishing between motion and static states. The accuracy can be formulated as:
    
    $$
    \alpha = \frac{N_{\text{correct}}}{N} \times 100\%,
    $$
    
    where \(N_{\text{correct}}\) and \(N\) represent the number of correct predictions and the total number of samples in the `test` folder, respectively.
    
3. The CSI files in `benchmark/motion_detection/evaluation_motion` and `benchmark/motion_detection/evaluation_static` are strictly for evaluating motion detection algorithms. Additionally, unlabeled CSI files in `benchmark/motion_detection/test` will be used for performance assessment, contributing **20% of the task**.

#### 3.2 Breathing Rate Dataset

The benchmark dataset used for CSI-based breathing rate evaluation is located in the `benchmark/breathing_rate/evaluation` folder. It consists of CSI files paired with their respective ground truth files, where the ground truth BPM values are obtained using a breathing belt. Each BPM value is computed from 15-second intervals and updated approximately every second via queue mechanism (FIFO).

1. The evaluation dataset comprises the following CSI files and their corresponding ground truth files:
    
    
    | CSI File | Ground Truth File |
    |:--------:|:-----------------:|
    | CSI20250227_193124.csv | gt_20250227_193124.csv |
    | CSI20250227_191018.csv | gt_20250227_191018.csv |

2. The benchmark employs **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** as the primary evaluation metric. MAE quantifies the absolute difference between the estimated and actual BPM values, providing an accurate measure of model performance. The formula of MAE can be expressed as:
    
    $$
    e_{\text{MAE}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |BPM_{\text{pred},i} - BPM_{\text{gt},i}|,
    $$
    
    where \(BPM_{\text{pred}, i}\) and \(BPM_{\text{gt}, i}\) represent the predicted and ground truth BPM values for the \(i\)-th sample, respectively.
    
3. Our baseline approach yields a **median MAE $\tilde{e}_{\text{MAE}}$ of 0.94 BPM**, demonstrating its effectiveness in breathing rate estimation.

4. The evaluation files under `benchmark/breathing_rate/evaluation` is only employed to evaluate your algorithm. The CSI files without labels under `benchmark/breathing_rate/test` will be considered as the performance evaluation marks, contributing **20% of the task**.
